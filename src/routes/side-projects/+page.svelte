            <p>A custom model trained on transcripts of existing podcasts for a given show. Then an in-episode interface is built for podcast hosts to recall things that have previously been discussed as well as stats and facts throughout the episode in real time.</p>

            <p>The pitch is simple; what if you could select tables within a restaurant when you make a reservation? There could easily be an up-charge for more desirable seats (more space, near windows, etc.)</p>

            <p>I was lucky enough to intern for some incredible firms when I was just starting out. With AI, however, interns realistically won't be able to provide the incremental value they once did. Without intern or vocational programs, how might young professionals gain experience and skills? This platform would aim to solve that problem.</p>
